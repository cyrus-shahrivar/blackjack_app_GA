Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery

Approach Taken:
- First approach was to layout scenes on wireframe, put together html skeleton, basic css, and basic javascript.  I then looked at design websites to understand color theory a bit more to make my game look aesthetically pleasing.  I made iterative tweaks to the css and html as I built the game logic.
- This first approach used prompts to guide the game logic, however, I found that the user experiences were annoying, so I rebuilt the interface with buttons made from scratch.
- I had initially done prompts in my first approach to reduce complexity while I was building the game.  One lesson learned was working with event listeners upfront reduces total build time.  Another lesson learned was realizing that button based games follow a more function driven paradigm rather than a continuous object interactivity paradigm.  Also, thoroughly understanding the game win states and triggers before programming is a must.

Installation Instructions:
- As long as you are using a modern browser (generally Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) that can parse html5, javascript, jquery, and css, then you are probably ok with just following the link above with no additional downloads.

Unsolved Known Problems:
- Would like to be more mobile responsive.
- Would like to add sounds events.
